* TODO Emphasize that checking too (if needed) is an efficient operation 

* TODO Nice to have TODO
** TODO Implement 3x3 pattern extraction
SCHEDULED: <2024-02-19 Mon>
** TODO Implement sampling
SCHEDULED: <2024-02-19 Mon>
** TODO Implement the constraints on top of WFC
SCHEDULED: <2024-02-20 Tue>
** TODO Implement mario level as circuit
SCHEDULED: <2024-02-21 Wed>
** DONE fix float division by zero error
** DONE set up saveing and loading bdd to the wrapper
** DONE clean up files
** DONE make a git push
** DONE Set up learning
** DONE figure out why the right most coner is sometimes wrong
** DONE Hash the assingnments
Hashing the assignments can also be seen as assigning a sample to a bucket. The assumption is everything in the bucket is close enough to considered repetition.
** DONE Have a check procedure to see if the answer is valid
** DONE Set up metrics class
** DONE Store results of experiments
** TODO Implement hamming distance
*** TODO easy of computing the hamming distance
** TODO hierachircal clustring
# ** TODO look into what the cube is, because randomizing that might also help
** TODO demonstrate circuit viability in godot
** TODO We can condition on it.

* TODO NEED TODO TODO
** DONE Uniform Sampling with model counts
** DONE Incorporate Adam's stuff
** DONE Compute marignal probs
** TODO Draw mario level
** TODO Generate figures:
*** TODO Amortized inference: Line go down
*** TODO Distance grid of marignal dists
*** TODO Generate 3 sample from uniform; 3 sample from ad-hoc
*** TODO Exhaustive expressive range analysis
*** TODO Chart analytic count; in terms of models counts of specific variables and in terms of conditioning on other things
That is we can find how many reachablle tiles in our generator expilittly.

** TODO Setup wfc experiments on server and run them
** TODO Setup ASP for wfc 
*** DO NOT MAKE AN EXPERIMENT CLASS FOR IT 
** TODO Setup ASP for platformer
** TODO Demonstrate support of online imprinting
Run experiments on observes on how little they cost

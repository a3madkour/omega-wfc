** DONE make a git push
** DONE Set up learning
** TODO figure out why the right most coner is sometimes wrong
** TODO Hash the assingnments
Hashing the assignments can also be seen as assigning a sample to a bucket. The assumption is everything in the bucket is close enough to conisdered repetition.
** TODO Emphasize that checking too (if needed) is an efficient operation 
** TODO Have a check procedure to see if the answer is valid
** TODO Store results of experiments
*** TODO Observe how often each hash shows up in the sampling before and after training
** TODO Set up metrics class

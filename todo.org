* TODO Emphasize that checking too (if needed) is an efficient operation 

* TODO Actual TODO
** DONE fix float division by zero error
** DONE set up saveing and loading bdd to the wrapper
** DONE clean up files
** DONE make a git push
** DONE Set up learning
** TODO figure out why the right most coner is sometimes wrong
** TODO Implement hamming distance
** DONE Hash the assingnments
Hashing the assignments can also be seen as assigning a sample to a bucket. The assumption is everything in the bucket is close enough to considered repetition.
** DONE Have a check procedure to see if the answer is valid
** DONE Set up metrics class
** TODO Store results of experiments
*** TODO Observe how often each hash shows up in the sampling before and after training
** TODO hierachircal clustring
** TODO look into what the cube is, because randomizing that might also help
** TODO demonstrate circuit viability in godot
** TODO Relate the knowledge compilation stuff to understanding the minimum sized program capable of expressing the design domain in question (reference Micheal Cook's student's paper)
